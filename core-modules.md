# Core Modules

Core Modules are the base of EGM:RP. They cannot and should not be disabled or tampered with. You can still read them (except for a few serverside files that are protected by our DRM) and understand what they are doing and how to use the tools, with wich they supply the rest of the gamemode, but you should never change anything in these files.

Everything can either be overridden or configured from your own custom gamemode.
